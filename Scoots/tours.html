                    <p>No trip to Cozumel is complete without a boat ride or two around the island's magnificently blue waters. Whether you hop on board to scuba dive through some of Cozumel's magnificent reefs or to simply take in the scenery during a sunset
                        sail, most travelers agree that chartering a boat is worth the time and money.</p>
